ST,Stream,"A body of running water moving under gravity flow in a defined channel. The channel may be entirely natural, or altered by engineering practices through straightening, dredging, and (or) lining. An entirely artificial channel should be qualified with the ""canal"" or ""ditch"" secondary site type."
ST-CA,Canal,"An artificial watercourse designed for navigation, drainage, or irrigation by connecting two or more bodies of water; it is larger than a ditch."

WE,Wetland,"Land where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (Cowardin, December 1979). Wetlands are found from the tundra to the tropics and on every continent except Antarctica. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands may be forested or unforested, and naturally or artificially created."
GW,Well,"A hole or shaft constructed in the earth intended to be used to locate, sample, or develop groundwater, oil, gas, or some other subsurface material. The diameter of a well is typically much smaller than the depth. Wells are also used to artificially recharge groundwater or to pressurize oil and gas production zones. Additional information about specific kinds of wells should be recorded under the secondary site types or the Use of Site field. Underground waste-disposal wells should be classified as waste-injection wells."

AW,Aggregate water-use establishment,"An Aggregate Water-Use Establishment represents an aggregate class of water-using establishments or individuals that are associated with a specific geographic location and water-use category, such as all the industrial users located within a county or all self-supplied domestic users in a county. The aggregate class of water-using establishments is identified using the national water-use category code and optionally classified using the Standard Industrial Classification System Code (SIC code) or North American Classification System Code (NAICS code). An aggregate water-use establishment site type is used when specific information needed to create sites for the individual facilities or users is not available or when it is not desirable to store the site-specific information in the database.

FA-WIW,Waste injection well,"A facility used to convey industrial waste, domestic sewage, brine, mine drainage, radioactive waste, or other fluid into an underground zone. An oil-test or deep-water well converted to waste disposal should be in this category.

Water-use place-of-use sites are establishments such as a factory, mill, store, warehouse, farm, ranch, or bank. A place-of-use site is further classified using the national water-use category code (C39) and optionally classified using the Standard Industrial Classification System Code (SIC code) or North American Classification System Code (NAICS code). See also: Aggregate water-use-establishment."
GL,Glacier,"Body of land ice that consists of recrystallized snow accumulated on the surface of the ground and moves slowly downslope (WSP-1541A) over a period of years or centuries. Since glacial sites move, the lat-long precision for these sites is usually coarse."
